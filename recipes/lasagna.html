        <h2 class="secondary-heading">Description</h2>
        <p class="desc-text">This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage
        cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        
        <h2 class="secondary-heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li><strong>Meat:</strong>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li><strong>Onion:</strong>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned tomatoes:</strong>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh herbs:</strong>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        </ul>
